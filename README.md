Data Science Projects for exploratory and professional purposes.
Projects include Kaggle competitions and CU Boulder's MS in Data Science coursework.

The projects were done with the intention of exploration and experimentation. They deviate, to some extent, from the guidelines, methods, and overall
'model' approaches to addressing the problem statement shown in course lectures and assignment solutions. This is to test the advantages and limits of the countless permutations and variations of hyperparameters, which helps get a hands-on 'feel' of how the packages and algorithms work.
